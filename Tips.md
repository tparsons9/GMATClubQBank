# Gre Quant Tips 
## Arithmetic
#### Summation of Ordered Fractions 
If you have an equation asking the sum of $$1 + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + ... + \frac{1}{n}$$
- Take $n!$ as the denominator
- The numerator is $n!$ divided by the position
- In the case of $n = 5$, $$\frac{\frac{5!}{1} + \frac{5!}{2} + ... + \frac{5!}{5}}{5!} = \frac{274}{120}$$
#### Terminating Decimals 
- If you are dividing by 5 or 2, you get a terminating decimal
- A combination of 5|2 and any other number, however, gives you a repeating ecimal

#### Function Symmetry 
- With the y-axis
    - Must be an "even" function
        - $f(x) = f(-x)
        - All exponents must be even (Note, constants are even ie. $2x^0$)
- With the origin (x-axis)
    - Must be an odd function
 
#### Roots of a polynomial 
- The sum of the roots is $\frac{-b}{a}$
- The product of roots is $\frac{c}{a}$

#### Sum of Two Primes
- If you see an even integer greater than 2, it is the sum of two primes
- The only way for an odd number to be the sum of two primes would be 2+odd

#### Prime Check 
- Quick way to check whether a number is prime is to take the $\sqrt{p}$ and only test if it is divisible by integers less than the resulting number.

#### Number of terms in a polynomial 
- $(x+y)^n$ will have $n+1$ terms
- Terms are separated y a + or - sign
- Degree is the highest exponent. $x^4$ and $xyz^2$ have the same degree of 4

#### Standard Deviation 
- Exists in proportion to the multiplier
- If you know the standard deviation before, you can multiply it by the multiplier to get the new standard deviation

#### Permutations 
- In cases where you have "Tommy and Anna must sit together", treat them as an entity
  - If there are 6 total friends, and T and A must sit together, then it is $5! * 2!$ total possibilities.
  - If you have 6 friends and T must sit next to A and J must sit next to P, it's $4! * 2! * 2!$ possibilities
    
## Geometry
#### Radius of a circle inscribed with an equilateral triangle
- If you draw a center point, where the bisected height of the triangle has two parts, label the segment extending to the base of the triangle as A and the point extending to the circle as B
    - The ratio of A:B exists as 1:2

#### Exterior Angle Theorem 
- If you have an angle labeled $y$ at the top of a triangle, and an exterior angle labeled $x$ at the base, take the opposite angle and label it $z$. Then $z+y = x$

#### Circle vs any other shape 
- If the circumference of a circle is the same as the perimeter of another shape, the area will always be greater because it has infinite sides

#### Number of diagonals in a polygon
$$\frac{(N - 3) * N}{2}$$
